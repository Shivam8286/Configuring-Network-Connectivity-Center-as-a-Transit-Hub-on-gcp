# Configuring-Network-Connectivity-Center-as-a-Transit-Hub-on-gcp

Network Connectivity Center (NCC) enables connecting different enterprise networks together that are outside of Google Cloud by leveraging Google's networkâ€”providing enterprises instant access to planet-scale reach and high reliability. Traffic between non-Google networks is referred to as data transfer traffic, which can occur using existing standard cloud network connectivity resources such as Cloud VPN, Dedicated or Partner Interconnect.

In this lab, you will go through the process of setting up NCC as a transit hub to route traffic between two non-Google networks using Google's backbone network.

Architecture
NCC consists of hub and spoke resources.

Hub

A hub is a global Google Cloud resource that supports multiple attached spokes. It provides a simple way to connect spokes together to enable data transfer across them. A hub can provide data transfer between different on-premises locations and a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network through its attached spokes.

Spoke

A spoke is a Google Cloud network resource connected to a hub. It is part of the hub, and can't be created without creating the hub first. A spoke routes traffic to remote network address blocks and enables the connection of multiple remote networks.

Spokes can be of one of the following types:

HA VPN tunnels
VLAN attachments
Router appliance instances that you or select partners deploy within Google Cloud
The following network topology is similar to a typical customer deployment having branch offices located in two geographically separate locations. For this lab, you are simulating two VPCs vpc-a, and vpc-b in Region 1, and Region 2 as the branch offices respectively.

The branch offices are connected to a VPC, vpc-transit, which is a central hub terminating a pair of HA VPNs. These VPNs are configured in a region closest to the branch offices. In the real world, these VPNs could be replaced using Interconnects.

You will configure the NCC hub in the vpc-transit network, and the two remote branch offices will be connected using the HA VPN tunnels as spokes.

Network topology project example

In this lab, you will achieve the following objectives:

Create a hub VPC called vpc-transit.
Create two remote branch office VPCs namely vpc-a and vpc-b.
Create HA VPN from vpa-a to vpc-transit, and vpc-b to vpc-transit.
Create a NCC hub resource and attach the HA VPNs as spokes.
Test the setup end to end deploying VMs in the remote branch office VPCs.
Prerequisites

Task 3. Configure HA VPN between the remote branch office VPCs and the transit hub VPC
Note: In this lab you are simulating the remote branch offices as Google Cloud VPCs, therefore using the steps listed to Create HA VPN between Google Cloud Networks.
For any practical implementation, you may replace the steps listed below with the steps for Creating an HA VPN gateway to a peer VPN gateway if you are using HA VPNs to connect to your branch offices.
In this section you will configure an HA VPN between the remote branch office VPCs (vpc-a and vpc-b) and the transit hub VPC (vpc-transit). HA VPN uses BGP for dynamically exchanging routes between Google Cloud and the peer network. Before configuring the HA VPNs, you need to create Cloud Routers associated with each VPC network.

Note: Learn more about Cloud Routers in the Cloud Router overview documentation.
